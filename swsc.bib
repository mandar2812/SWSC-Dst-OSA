abstract = {We have compared six Dst forecast models using 63 intense geomagnetic storms (Dst ≤ −100 nT) that occurred from 1998 to 2006. For comparison, we estimated linear correlation coefficients and RMS errors between the observed Dst data and the predicted Dst during the geomagnetic storm period as well as the difference of the value of minimum Dst ($\Delta$Dstmin) and the difference in the absolute value of Dst minimum time ($\Delta$tDst) between the observed and the predicted. As a result, we found that the model by Temerin and Li (2002, 2006) gives the best prediction for all parameters when all 63 events are considered. The model gives the average values: the linear correlation coefficient of 0.94, the RMS error of 14.8 nT, the $\Delta$Dstmin of 7.7 nT, and the absolute value of $\Delta$tDst of 1.5 hour. For further comparison, we classified the storm events into two groups according to the magnitude of Dst. We found that the model of Temerin and Lee (2002, 2006) is better than the other models for the events having −100 ≤ Dst {\textless} −200 nT, and three recent models (the model of Wang et al. (2003), the model of Temerin and Li (2002, 2006), and the model of Boynton et al. (2011b)) are better than the other three models for the events having Dst ≤ −200 nT. },

The same model applied to the first half of 2000 gave a prediction efficiency of 91\%, a linear correlation coefficient of 0.95, and a RMS error of 7.9 nT. The modeled Dst is a sum of three terms that have growth and decay, a dynamic pressure term, an interplanetary magnetic field term, and some offset terms. The main innovations are that the decay terms have different time constants ranging from 5 days to 1 hour and that all the terms except the offsets depend on the angle of the Earth's dipole with respect to the solar wind velocity. This result shows that the magnetosphere is highly predictable and that chaotic behavior within the magnetosphere has little influence on the large-scale currents that determine Dst.},

abstract = {An algorithm is presented for predicting the ground-based Dst index solely from a knowledge of the velocity and density of the solar wind and the north-south solar magnetospheric component of the interplanetary magnetic field. The three key elements of this model are an adjustment for solar wind dynamic pressure, an injection rate linearly proportional to the dawn-to-dusk component of the interplanetary electric field which is zero for electric fields below 0.5 mV m−1, and an exponential decay rate of the ring current with an e folding time of 7.7 hours. The algorithm is used to predict the Dst signature of seven geomagnetic storm intervals in 1967 and 1968. In addition to being quite successful, considering the simplicity of the model, the algorithm pinpoints the causes of various types of storm behavior. A main phase is initiated whenever the dawn-to-dusk solar magnetospheric component of the interplanetary electric field becomes large and positive. It is preceded by an initial phase of increased Dst if the solar wind dynamic pressure increases suddenly prior to the main phase. The recovery phase is initiated when the injection rate governed by the interplanetary electric field drops below the ring current decay rate associated with the ring current strength built up during the main phase. Variable recovery rates are generally due to additional injection during the recovery phase. This one algorithm accounts for magnetospheric behavior at quiet and at disturbed times and seems capable of predicting the behavior of Dst during even the largest of storms.},

abstract="In the context of the space weather predictions, forecasting ring current strength (and of the Dst index) based on the solar wind upstream conditions is of specific interest for predicting the occurrence of geomagnetic storms. In the present paper, we have studied separately its two components: the Dst injection and decay. In particular, we have verified the validity of the Burton's equation for estimating the ring current energy balance using the equatorial electric merging field instead of the original parameter V Bs (V is the solar wind speed and Bs is the southward component of the Interplanetary Magnetic Field, IMF). Then, based on this equation, we have used the phasespace method to determine the best-fit approximations for the ring current injection and decay as functions of the equatorial merging electric field (Em). Results indicate that the interplanetary injection is statistically higher than in previous estimations using V Bs. Specifically, weak but not-null ring current injection can be observed even during northward IMF, when previous studies considered it to be always zero. Moreover, results about the ring current decay indicate that the rate of Dst decay is faster than its predictions derived by using V Bs. In addition, smaller quiet time ring current and solar wind pressure corrections are contributing to Dst estimates obtained by Em instead of V Bs. These effects are compensated, so that the statistical Dst predictions using the equatorial electric merging field or using V Bs are about equivalent.",

abstract = {The polarity of a magnetic cloud refers to its changing magnetic field direction. It is classified as S-N polarity when the magnetic field rotates from southward to northward and N-S polarity when the field is initially northward and rotates southward. A study of 29 magnetic cloud events has found that 40–45\% of magnetic clouds, independent of polarity, are followed by a fast solar wind stream which compresses the tail end of the cloud. The compression results in an increase in the solar wind plasma density and in 64\% of the cases an increase in the magnetic field strength towards the latter part of the cloud. Such tail end compression can have a significant effect upon geomagnetic storm intensity if the magnetic cloud is of N-S polarity. This is because only in the N-S polarity case does the compression coincide with the southward IMF portion of the cloud. To test the “geoeffectiveness” of N-S versus S-N magnetic clouds three selected magnetic cloud events, two of S-N polarity and one of N-S polarity, are investigated in terms of their geomagnetic response through measured and estimated Dst values. It is found that there is an increased geoeffectiveness of N-S polarity clouds due to both an increased solar wind dynamic pressure and a compressed southward field associated with a following fast solar wind stream.},

abstract = {This empirical analysis of the terrestrial ring current, as measured by Dst, uses conditional probability density in Dst phase space to determine the evolution of the ring current. This analysis method does not assume a dynamic equation, but merely requires that the evolution of Dst depends on Dst and the solar wind. Our simple model, with seven nontrivial parameters, describes the dynamics of 30 years of hourly Dst with solar wind data provided by the OMNI database. The solar wind coupling is assumed to be determined by VBs. We arrive at a dynamic equation nearly identical to the Burton equation (Burton et al., 1975) with a slight correction. The method is restricted to Dst > −150 nT owing to the rarity of larger excursions. We show that the ring current decay lifetime varies with VBs but not with Dst, and we relate this variation to the position of convection boundaries in the magnetosphere. Convection boundaries closer to the Earth result in shorter charge exchange decay times owing to the higher neutral density near the Earth. The decay time in hours varies as τ = 2.40 exp [9.74/(4.69+VBs)] with VBs in millivolts per meter. We also show that the energy injection function as derived by Burton et al. is essentially correct. The injection Q is zero for VBs < Ec = 0.49 mV/m, and it is Q = −4.4(VBs − Ec) for VBs > Ec. We derive the correction for magnetopause contamination: Dst* = Dst −7.26P1/2 + 11 nT, where P is solar wind dynamic pressure in nanopascals. Finally, we apply the model to a moderate storm and to an intense storm. We demonstrate that, in spite of the fact that spacecraft observe compositional changes in the ring current at intense Dst, the dynamics of the two storms are not obviously different in the context of our model. We demonstrate that the generally observed dependence of the decay parameter on Dst is actually an alias of the coincidence of intense Dst and intense VBs.},

In the present study, ERR is used to identify the most important solar wind parameters, which control the fluxes of energetic electrons at geosynchronous orbit. The results show that for lower energies, the fluxes are indeed controlled by the solar wind velocity, as was assumed before. For the lowest energy range studied here (24.1 keV), the solar wind velocity of the current day is the most important control parameter for the current day's electron flux. As the energy increases, the solar wind velocity of the previous day becomes the most important factor. For the higher energy electrons (around 1 MeV), the solar wind velocity registered 2 days in the past is the most important controlling parameter. Such a dependence can, perhaps, be explained by either local acceleration processes due to the interaction with plasma waves or by radial diffusion if lower energy electrons possess higher mobility. However, in the case of even higher energies (2.0 MeV), the solar wind density replaces the velocity as the key control parameter. Such a dependence could be a result of solar wind density influence on the dynamics of various waves and pulsations that affect acceleration and loss of relativistic electrons. The study also shows that statistically the variations of daily high energy electron fluxes show little dependence on the daily averaged Bz, daily time duration of the southward IMF, and daily integral ∫Bsdt (where Bs is the southward component of IMF).},

Geomagnetic storms are complex sequences of physical processes, which include both microprocesses, (e.g., magnetic reconnection) and macroprocesses (relaxation of the ring current around the Earth, which is the main contributor to the geomagnetic storms). To derive a mathematical description of the magnetospheric dynamics from first principles the models of all processes involved should be conjugated into a global model. This goal will ultimately be accomplished. However the present level of understanding means that this will not happen in the foreseeable future. An alternative approach used here is based on system identification. A physically interpretable continuous time model capturing the magnetospheric dynamics has been identified directly from measurements of the solar wind and geomagnetic Dst index. It is shown that such a model can provide reliable forecasts of geomagnetic disturbances.},

The algorithm takes inputs from ACE and a handful of ground-based magnetometers to predict the next upcoming Kp in real time. The model yields a correlation coefficient of over 86\% when predicting Kp with a lead time of 1 hour and over 85\% for a 2 hour ahead prediction, significantly larger than the Kp persistence of 0.80. The Boyle Index, available in near-real time from http://space.rice.edu/ISTP/wind.html, has been in use for over 5 years now to predict geomagnetic activity. The logarithm of both 3-hour and 1-hour averages of the Boyle Index correlates well with the following Kp: Kp = 8.93 log10 < Boyle Index> –12.55. Using the Boyle Index alone, the algorithm yields a correlation coefficient of 85\% when predicting Kp with a lead time of 1 hour and over 84\% for a 3 hour ahead prediction, nearly as good as when using Kp in the history but without any possibility of “persistence contamination.” Although the Boyle Index generally overestimates the polar cap potential for severe events, it does predict that severe activity will occur. Also, 1-hour <Boyle Index> value less than 100 kV is a good indicator that the magnetosphere will be quiet. However, some storm events with Kp > 6 occur when the Boyle Index is relatively low; the new algorithm is successful in predicting those events by capturing the influence of preconditioning.},

Our models yield correlation coefficients of over 0.88, 0.86, and 0.83 for 1 h predictions of Kp, Dst, and AE, respectively, and 0.86, 0.84, and 0.80 when predicting the same but 3 h ahead. Our 6 h ahead predictions, however, have slightly higher uncertainties. Furthermore, the paper also tests other solar wind functions—the Newell driver, the Borovsky control function, and adding solar wind pressure term to the Boyle index—for their ability to predict geomagnetic activity. },

@ARTICLE{Xavier-De-Souza2010,
abstract = {We present a new class of methods for the global optimization of continuous variables based on simulated annealing (SA). The coupled SA (CSA) class is characterized by a set of parallel SA processes coupled by their acceptance probabilities. The coupling is performed by a term in the acceptance probability function, which is a function of the energies of the current states of all SA processes. A particular CSA instance method is distinguished by the form of its coupling term and acceptance probability. In this paper, we present three CSA instance methods and compare them with the uncoupled case, i.e., multistart SA. The primary objective of the coupling in CSA is to create cooperative behavior via information exchange. This aim helps in the decision of whether uphill moves will be accepted. In addition, coupling can provide information that can be used online to steer the overall optimization process toward the global optimum. We present an example where we use the acceptance temperature to control the variance of the acceptance probabilities with a simple control scheme. This approach leads to much better optimization efficiency, because it reduces the sensitivity of the algorithm to initialization parameters while guiding the optimization process to quasioptimal runs. We present the results of extensive experiments and show that the addition of the coupling and the variance control leads to considerable improvements with respect to the uncoupled case and a more recently proposed distributed version of SA.},

abstract = "Abstract Most measures of magnetospheric activity – including auroral power (AP), magnetotail stretching, and ring current intensity – are best predicted by solar wind-magnetosphere coupling functions which approximate the frontside magnetopause merging rate. However radiation belt fluxes are best predicted by a simpler function, namely the solar wind speed, v. Since most theories of how these high energy electrons arise are associated with repeated rapid dipolarizations such as associated with substorms, this apparent discrepancy could be reconciled under the hypothesis that the frequency of substorms tracks v rather than the merging rate – despite the necessity of magnetotail flux loading prior to substorms. Here we investigate this conjecture about v and substorm probability. Specifically, a continuous list of substorm onsets compiled from SuperMAG covering January 1, 1997 through December 31, 2007 are studied. The continuity of SuperMAG data and near continuity of solar wind measurements minimize selection bias. In fact v is a much better predictor of onset probability than is the overall merging rate, with substorm odds rising sharply with v. Some loading by merging is necessary, and frontside merging does increase substorm probability, but nearly as strongly as does v taken alone. Likewise, the effects of dynamic pressure, p, are smaller than simply v taken by itself. Changes in the solar wind matter, albeit modestly. For a given level of v (or Bz), a change in v (or Bz) will increase the odds of a substorm for at least 2 h following the change. A decrease in driving elevates substorm probabilities to a greater extent than does an increase, partially supporting external triggering. Yet current v is the best single predictor of subsequently observing a substorm. These results explain why geomagnetically quiet years and active years are better characterized by low or high v (respectively) than by the distribution of merging estimators. It appears that the flow of energy through the magnetosphere is determined by frontside merging, but the burstiness of energy dissipation depends primarily on v. "
