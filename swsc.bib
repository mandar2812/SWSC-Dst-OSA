@ARTICLE{Ji2012,
abstract = {We have compared six Dst forecast models using 63 intense geomagnetic storms (Dst ≤ −100 nT) that occurred from 1998 to 2006. For comparison, we estimated linear correlation coefficients and RMS errors between the observed Dst data and the predicted Dst during the geomagnetic storm period as well as the difference of the value of minimum Dst ($\Delta$Dstmin) and the difference in the absolute value of Dst minimum time ($\Delta$tDst) between the observed and the predicted. As a result, we found that the model by Temerin and Li (2002, 2006) gives the best prediction for all parameters when all 63 events are considered. The model gives the average values: the linear correlation coefficient of 0.94, the RMS error of 14.8 nT, the $\Delta$Dstmin of 7.7 nT, and the absolute value of $\Delta$tDst of 1.5 hour. For further comparison, we classified the storm events into two groups according to the magnitude of Dst. We found that the model of Temerin and Lee (2002, 2006) is better than the other models for the events having −100 ≤ Dst {\textless} −200 nT, and three recent models (the model of Wang et al. (2003), the model of Temerin and Li (2002, 2006), and the model of Boynton et al. (2011b)) are better than the other three models for the events having Dst ≤ −200 nT. },

@ARTICLE{Xavier-De-Souza2010,
abstract = {We present a new class of methods for the global optimization of continuous variables based on simulated annealing (SA). The coupled SA (CSA) class is characterized by a set of parallel SA processes coupled by their acceptance probabilities. The coupling is performed by a term in the acceptance probability function, which is a function of the energies of the current states of all SA processes. A particular CSA instance method is distinguished by the form of its coupling term and acceptance probability. In this paper, we present three CSA instance methods and compare them with the uncoupled case, i.e., multistart SA. The primary objective of the coupling in CSA is to create cooperative behavior via information exchange. This aim helps in the decision of whether uphill moves will be accepted. In addition, coupling can provide information that can be used online to steer the overall optimization process toward the global optimum. We present an example where we use the acceptance temperature to control the variance of the acceptance probabilities with a simple control scheme. This approach leads to much better optimization efficiency, because it reduces the sensitivity of the algorithm to initialization parameters while guiding the optimization process to quasioptimal runs. We present the results of extensive experiments and show that the addition of the coupling and the variance control leads to considerable improvements with respect to the uncoupled case and a more recently proposed distributed version of SA.},

@ARTICLE{Nelder1965,
abstract = {A method is described for the minimization of a function of n variables, which depends on the comparison of function values at the (n + 1) vertices of a general simplex, followed by the replacement of the vertex with the highest value by another point. The simplex adapts itself to the local landscape, and contracts on to the final minimum. The method is shown to be effective and computationally compact. A procedure is given for the estimation of the Hessian matrix in the neighbourhood of the minimum, needed in statistical estimation problems.},
